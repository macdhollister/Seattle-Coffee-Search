                  <p class="card-text description">	Seattle Coffee Search is a community-focused specialty coffee-search web-application designed to accommodate discerning Seattleites. Defined by famously rich topography, Seattle's neighborhoods have, to various degrees, grown in petri dishes. As the city's tech boom advances, its population grows, neighborhoods densify, transpo networks are developed, and its culture homogenizes—but its neighborhoods still retain, to various degrees, their unique flavor. Or some develop new flavors for new tastes. Tastes—are we talking about coffee here? I could go for a cup of coffee. There are a thousand coffeeshops in this city—third spaces to enjoy (not work, nor home, but the vaunted public living room). Some spots are better or worse than others for various reasons. Sometimes you want to go somewhere new to enjoy yourself, or maybe you find yourself across town in a less-familiar neighborhood. Whatever your purpose, Seattle Coffee Search’ll help you find your next cup. Play around with the data collection and see what you find.</p>
                  <p class="card-text description">How does it work? Start by selecting the card of the neighborhood you’re in or would like to get coffee in. Using both the Yelp and Google Maps APIs, as well as Seattle city governmental data, the fifty top Yelp-rated coffeeshops, cafés, etc. in that area are then populated with markers on the Google Map. Click them to view pertinent business information, such as the business’s name, rating, and address. It’s as easy as that. Drag and click freely to explore the data collection through the map interface and check out the Seattle coffee scene. Get to know the cafés where you are, where you find yourself, and where you want to be—and remember: stay caffeinated. You must always stay caffeinated.</p>
